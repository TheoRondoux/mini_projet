# Heros VS Monsters
*Made by Th√©o Rondoux*

## About this project
The purpose of this project was to use the knowledge I obtained during my C++ lessons at Junia ISEN.

The subject was simple: create a little game, that can be played  in the console. This game consists of a fight between a group of 4 heros and 10 monsters.

## Rules of the game
As a hero, you can choose between three different classes. Each one has its specific characteristics:

### The knight:
A strong character, ready for battle!

He has between 50 and 70 HP, and wields a halbert or a longsword, both dealing 8 points of damage. His sturdy armor grants him 4 to 6 points of defense.

His special ability ? He increase his damage by 5 points.

### The cleric:
The mystic guy!

He has between 40 and 60 HP, he wields either an axe or a mace, both dealing 6 points of damage. He has between 3 and 5 points of defense. 

His ability ? healing himself of 5 points while fighting.
